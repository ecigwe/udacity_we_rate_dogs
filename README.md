## WeRateDogs : A Data Wrangling Project

## by Igwe Emmanuel

### Objectives

This is a repository for Udacity Data Analyst Project 2 (Data Wrangling). The dataset used in the project is also included in this repository. The aim is to broaden my data gathering skills as well as to produce Three Insights from the analysis.

## Installation

### The libraries/packages used on this project include:

1. Pandas – For storing and manipulating structured data. Pandas functionality is built on NumPy (upgrade to version 0.25.1)
2. Numpy – For multi-dimensional array, matrix data structures and, performing mathematical operations
3. Matplotlib – For all visualizations
4. Tweepy - open-sourced, easy-to-use for accessing the Twitter API. It gives you an interface to access the API from your Python application.
5. Requests - allows you to send HTTP requests using Python.
6. os - For interacting with the operating system
7. json - For parsing JSON into a Python dictionary or list. It can also convert Python dictionaries or lists into JSON strings.
8. re - provides a set of powerful regular expression facilities, which allows one to quickly check whether a given string matches a given pattern (using the match function), or contains such a pattern (using the search function).
   Introduction
   I gathered data using three different methods in this project;

Using pandas read_csv
Using Requests library to gather image predictions data
Tweepy library to gather additional data via Twitter API The three datasets were assessed and cleaned individually, then later merged as one.

## Project Methodology

### The main steps for this project can be summarized as follows:

Data Wrangling
Data Gathering
Data Assessment
Data Cleaning
Analysis/Visualization

## Results

### Based on the data and analysis carried out;

majority of tweets are from iphones.

most tweets count comes from twitter clients

most favourite count comes from iphone

### Limitations

1. over 1000 tweets dont contain dog stages
2. come dogs dont have names
